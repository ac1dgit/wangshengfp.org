Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.

## **Character Overview**

_Authored by Leifa_

![](/faq/navia/navia.png)

Navia is a 5-star Geo Claymore character aligned with Ousia whose kit revolves around gaining Crystal Shrapnel charges to strengthen her Elemental Skill. Crystal Shrapnel charges can be gained from collecting Crystallize Shards or periodically from her Elemental Burst, dealing damage frequently from off-field. After using her Elemental Skill, Navia will gain a short Geo Infusion in order to deal some extra damage whilst on-field.

Navia can be played both as an on-field DPS or as an off-field DPS. If used on-field, players can use Navia’s infused Normal Attacks and treat her as a main carry. She can also be played as an off-field DPS, where she ignores the infusion and relies solely on her Skill and Burst to deal her damage with minimal field time. Preferably, she will be played alongside Pyro, Electro, Cryo and Hydro teammates, due to her A4 Passive granting an extra 20% ATK for each teammate of those elements, which can stack up to two times.

## **Talents**

    ![](/faq/navia/quickswap.png)

### Analysis

Navia’s kit revolves around using her Burst and Normal Attacks to maximize the damage output of her Skill, which is a powerful shotgun blast to the face of enemies. Her kit is overall synergistic with many ways to buff her own damage. She is also one of the few Geo characters to effectively utilize Crystallize reactions even when shielded by someone else like Zhongli, setting a new precedent for Geo DPS characters.

### Talent Overview

**Normal Attack: Blunt Refusal**

-   Four consecutive strikes; spinning Charged Attack

Navia’s Normal and Charged Attacks are buffed by her First Ascension Passive, offering an absolute Geo infusion that cannot be overwritten and a large boost to her damage.

That said, since Navia will need to utilize her Normal Attack Talent to maximize her kit’s damage output, it’s recommended to level this Talent as high as possible, but not before Navia’s Skill.

**Elemental Skill: Ceremonial Crystalshot**

-   Gains a stack (6 max) whenever anyone obtains a Crystallize shard. On Skill use, she consumes all her stacks to hit the enemy a number of times (5-11) based on her stacks (0-3). Each stack beyond the third that’s consumed will each buff her Skill DMG by 15%, up to 45% max. Has two uses per rotation.

The bread-and-butter of Navia’s kit. It’s easy to both acquire max stacks for each Skill use and hit the enemy with every hit. As a Claymore-wielder using Normal Attacks, you’re going to be in point-blank range with your enemy anyways.

Navia’s Skill is more than half of her damage output, which makes this talent a top priority to maximize.

**Elemental Burst: As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute**

-   One initial hit, 17 smaller hits over time. Hits from Burst generate one Crystal Shrapnel stack every 2.4 seconds.

One of Navia’s primary ways to gain stacks and generate Crystallize shards, which is especially valuable on her Best-in-Slot artifact set, Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods.

While it offers plenty of utility, it is not an exceptional source of damage output, so this talent can be leveled last.

**Ascension 1: Undisclosed Distribution Channels**

-   For four seconds after using her Skill, the Normal Attack Talent is infused with Geo and cannot be overridden. Additionally, attacks using her Normal Attack Talent gain a 40% DMG Bonus

This is the main reason to use Navia’s Normal Attacks. Without it, she would have the same boring Normal Attacks as a typical 4-Star Claymore wielder. Most of the time, you’ll be using Normal Attacks.
**Ascension 4: Mutual Assistance Network**

-   For each Pyro, Electro, Hydro, Or Cryo character in your party, Navia gains 20% ATK, maxing out at 40% (two different elements).

Another incentive to pair Navia with other non-Geo characters, which is recommended in order to maximize Crystallize generation.

**Utility Passive: Painstaking Transaction**

-   20% more rewards on Fontaine expeditions.

You should probably just mine for ore instead, but there may be a non-zero number of cases where this comes in handy.

## Constellations

_Authored by Ac1d_

![](/faq/navia/c1.png)

### Constellation 1 - A Lady's Rules for Keeping a Courteous Distance

_Each stack of Crystal Shrapnel consumed when Navia uses Ceremonial Crystalshot will restore 3 Energy to her and decrease the CD of As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute by 1s. Up to 9 Energy can be gained this way, and the CD of "As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute" can be decreased by up to 3s._

Completely fixes any ER issues she might have in any possible team by effectively making her Burst a 42 energy cost from the original 60. Power depends on her original Energy Recharge needs at c0. More information about this Constellation can be found in the Energy Recharge section. It is worth noting that this Constellation will not be a damage improvement if she can run 100% ER, but that requires abundant enemy particles or running more than 1 extra geo character, which is not recommended.

_DPS% Increase vs. C0: ~13%_

_Rating: 4/5_

![](/faq/navia/c2.png)

### Constellation 2 - The President's Pursuit of Victory

_Each stack of Crystal Shrapnel consumed will increase the CRIT Rate of this Ceremonial Crystalshot instance by 12%. CRIT Rate can be increased by up to 36% in this way. In addition, when Ceremonial Crystalshot hits an opponent, one Cannon Fire Support shot from As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute will strike near the location of the hit. Up to one instance of Cannon Fire Support can be triggered each time Ceremonial Crystalshot is used, and DMG dealt by said Cannon Fire Support this way is considered Elemental Burst DMG._

Provides 36% CRIT Rate for her Skill damage. However, players will need to adjust her CRIT Rate to around 64% in order to not surpass 100% CRIT Rate. It also adds 2 extra hits to her Burst, which will be a minor increase to her damage and may generate an extra stack of Crystal Shrapnel.

_DPS% Increase vs. C1: 14%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0: ~29%_

_Rating: 4/5_

![](/faq/navia/c3.png)

### Constellation 3 - Businesswoman's Broad Vision

_Increases the Level of Ceremonial Crystalshot by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Additional damage on Skill, which is her main source of damage.

_DPS% Increase vs. C2: 10%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0: ~42%_

_Rating: 3/5_

![](/faq/navia/c4.png)

### Constellation 4 - The Oathsworn Never Capitulate

_When As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute hits an opponent, that opponent's Geo RES will be decreased by 20% for 8s._

Buffs all her abilities. Combined with Geo Resonance’s effect, it simulates having Viridescent Venerer active but for Geo.

_DPS% Increase vs. C3: 9.5%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0: ~55%_

_Rating: 3/5_

![](/faq/navia/c5.png)

### Constellation 5 - Negotiator's Resolute Negotiations

_Increases the Level of As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

This Constellation does not provide a sizable benefit due to Navia’s Burst being only a minor portion to her overall damage.

_DPS% Increase vs. C4: 2.8%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0: ~60%_

_Rating: 1/5_

![](/faq/navia/c6.png)

### Constellation 6 - The Flexible Finesse of the Spina's President

_If more than 3 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel are consumed when using Ceremonial Crystalshot, each stack consumed beyond the first 3 increases the CRIT DMG of that Ceremonial Crystalshot by 45%, and any stacks consumed beyond the first 3 are returned to Navia._

Navia’s strongest Constellation by far. It increases her Skill damage by about 40% if she has all 6 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel, which enables her to deal massive amounts of damage in an instant, increasing her already substantial frontload.

_DPS% Increase vs. C5: 26%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0: ~93-100%_

_Rating: 5/5_

## **ER Requirement**

_Authored by Ac1d_

In teams lacking Favonius weapons, Navia finds herself needing upwards of 190% ER. Additionally, due to Navia’s curse of being Geo, she has limited options when it comes to generating Geo particles, and her best options rely on Geo constructs to create particles, which can break very easily.

It is strongly recommended to use Zhongli as a Favonius holder and funnel the particles to Navia. This is easily achieved and ties into her playstyle as it is typical on rotations to use Zhongli’s Hold Skill then swap to Navia to activate her Burst. Doing this will reduce her ER requirements by 20% to 30%, which is immensely valuable.

By playing in a way that Zhongli’s pillar is not destroyed, you can further reduce her ER by another 30%, bringing her to a comfortable ER need of 130%. Nonetheless, there are alternatives like using Ningguang or Itto as particle generators, who can reliably provide similar levels of Energy as Zhongli’s pillar.

![](/faq/navia/erreq.png)

Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).

## Artifacts

_Authored by Duckfero_

### Artifact Stats

**Sands of Eon:** ATK%
**Goblet of Eonothem:** Geo DMG%
**Circlet of Logos:** CRIT

ER sands can be considered, especially if Navia is played as a quickswap unit.

**Substats:** ER until requirement > CRIT DMG = CRIT Rate > ATK%

### Artifact Sets

![](/faq/navia/4whispers.png)
**4PC Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods:**

BiS in practically every team except in a Mono Element team when Navia is a sub DPS. It gives a decent amount of Geo DMG Bonus with the condition of being shielded by a Crystallize reaction. However, it might not be easy to maintain the shield against aggressive enemies because it is somewhat weak, and having another shielder in the team doesn’t help since two shields cannot stack on top of another (both shields will each take 100% of damage). Although, even if you lose the effect for the last few Normal Attacks, this set is still Best-in-Slot.

![](/faq/navia/4mh.png)
**4PC Marechaussee Hunter:**

Very competitive option with Nighttime Whispers set but Furina is required in the team as the only reliable way to drain HP is through Furina’s Skill. However, it is not as good as it looks, since you will likely have 0 or 1 stack of this set for Navia’s first Skill (since stacks can only be gained while on-field, and stacks cannot be gained during a Burst animation due to i-frames). This is still a very good option, just slightly behind the signature set even if we consider this issue, especially if you don’t want to farm the other set.

It is recommended to build less than 64% CRIT Rate to avoid overcapping, but it’s better to have more than 55-60% CRIT Rate, because it would be a shame if the first E has only 40% CRIT Rate after all.

![](/faq/navia/4gt.png)
**4pc Golden Troupe:**

Good option which is only slightly better than 2pc combos, because it buffs the Elemental Skill, which is about 50% of her total DPS (on rotation n°2). It is recommended to switch out between the 2 Skills to make sure both get the 70% Damage Bonus. If you don’t, it’s only equal or below the 2pc combos. Furthermore, make sure to switch out between Burst and Skill to guarantee the 70% Damage Bonus. The set is a bit more competitive if you play Navia as a sub DPS, since a significant portion of her damage comes from her Skill.

![](/faq/navia/2mix.png)
**2PC Skill/Geo/ATK/ER combos**

2pc combos are still a great option if you have good substats and don’t want to farm Navia’s signature set. It is about 11-12% weaker than her best set. The 2pc combos effects are also unconditional, unlike most 4pc sets. With Bennett, 2pc Geo becomes better than 2pc ATK. Without Bennett, the 2pc ATK is better overall.

![](/faq/navia/4ap.png)
**4pc Archaic Petra**

This option is very competitive (sometimes Best-in-Slot) if you play Navia as sub DPS in a Mono Element team. Although Navia loses about 20% of her personal damage compared to her best set, it is still usually a gain in overall team DPS in teams where Navia’s DPS contribution isn’t high.

![](/faq/navia/4mix.png)
**4PC Gladiator's Finale / 4PC Husk of Opulent Dreams / 4PC Vermillion Hereafter**

These options are viable, but there is less than 1% difference between them and a 2pc combo. They can still be considered if the substats are very good. Keep in mind that the Vermillion set is only viable with Furina in the team because her drain mechanic is required.

## **Weapons**

_Authored by Emiliabyss_

![](/faq/navia/verdict.png)
**Verdict:**

Navia’s signature weapon and Best-in-Slot. Most signature weapons have about a 10-15% advantage over other options, but for Navia, there are three competitors within about 5% of this weapon. There’s nothing particularly interesting about this weapon that will change your playstyle, so just consider it to be a good stat stick.

![](/faq/navia/serpent.png)
**Serpent Spine (R5)**

Assumes max stacks, which is easy to accomplish in Spiral Abyss. Just make Navia the party lead and wait for all the stacks to accumulate before hitting start on the floor. Time and time again, Serpent Spine has shown itself to be of impeccable value to Claymore-wielders, and even with the new Battle Pass options, this reigns supreme over all other 4-star and 5-star options.

Make sure to use a CRIT Rate hat, and not a CRIT DMG hat, since Navia’s CRIT DMG Ascension stat compensates for the lack of CRIT DMG Hat. On most other characters, Serpent Spine wants a CRIT DMG hat.

![](/faq/navia/redhorn.png)
**Redhorn Stonethresher:**

A massive CRIT DMG stat stick with the added bonus of buffing her Normal Attacks a small amount. There isn’t much else to say here. 88% CRIT DMG is hard to ignore, and the numbers show. This weapon becomes better if you’re using the Husk of Opulent Dreams artifact set.

![](/faq/navia/beacon.png)
**Beacon of the Reed Sea (One Passive Trigger):**

Good due to its CRIT Rate stat and, at minimum, 20% ATK boost. It’s important to note that the first Skill does not grant stacks. It has the potential to surpass other weapons if she gets hit, but if you’re not perpetually shielded with Navia, you have probably done something wrong in your gameplay to drop your DPS in other ways.

![](/faq/navia/wgs.png)
**Wolf’s Gravestone / The Unforged:**

Both weapons are more than 10% less than Navia’s signature weapon, and both have similar effects. Unforged assumes a shield at all times because Navia also wants a shield at all times. If you end up not using Bennett on your team, these weapons become much more valuable. Keep in mind that Wolf’s Gravestone can buff teammates as well, even if that buff is not reliable.

![](/faq/navia/sac.png)
**Sacrificial Greatsword / "Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword":**

These perform slightly better than craftable options, and the event weapon is very easy to acquire. If you help all of the Melusines, the 48% ATK boost is much appreciated.

As for Sacrificial Greatsword, its value skyrockets if you can somehow get 18 stacks (6 for each Skill) per rotation, but without any stacks active, the extra damage is insignificant, as it’s half the motion value and can lengthen rotations. Current calculations assume no stacks on the 3rd Skill use.

![](/faq/navia/craft.png)
**Katsuragikiri Nagamasa / Tidal Shadow:**

Tidal Shadow outshines Katsuragikiri if she starts her rotations at less than full health, but this is hard to manage on the first floor of Spiral Abyss and with Zhongli’s shield. Katsuragiri Nagamasa satisfies most of her Energy Recharge requirements while being a more selfish version of a Favonius weapon; she gains more energy, but only for herself. Katsuragikiri also buffs Navia’s Skill damage, which is much-desired.

## **Team Building**

_Authored by Whalien_

### On-field DPS

**Navia | Geo | Flex | Flex**
![](/faq/navia/onfielddps.png)

Navia’s team building strategy focuses on having 2 Pyro/Electro/Cryo/Hydro units with her to activate her A4 passive which gives her up to 40 ATK%. In addition to the previous units, Navia heavily favors a second Geo unit to activate Geo Resonance, help with off-field Crystallize generation, and provide Energy.

#### Teammates

**Geo options:**

-   **Zhongli** - Zhongli is a very strong candidate for the Geo slot, as he brings a strong shield for Geo resonance and universal 20% RES Shred. He can hold 4pc Tenacity of the Millielith or simply 2pc combinations of HP for better Shield Strength.
-   **Albedo** - Albedo is another option for the Geo slot, with solid personal damage and consistent Crystallize and Energy generation. He can be built with 4pc Husk of Opulent Dreams or 4pc Golden Troupe.
-   **Geo MC** - Geo MC is a strong option as a 4\*, with high particle generation, a CRIT Rate buff, and solid personal DPS. However, their constructs, especially from skill, can prevent Navia from hitting enemies, whether by covering them in front or raising them up.

**The two remaining slots can be any combination of buffers or off-field DPS:**

-   **Furina** - provides a strong buff, but requires a teamwide healer to consistently take advantage of it. She also has some Hydro application which helps generate Crystallize shards, and decent off-field DPS, but she does lengthen rotations. She wants 4pc Golden Troupe.
-   \*_Kokomi_ - serves well as a healer in teams with Furina, brings strong AoE Hydro application for Crystallize, and can carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers to help buff Navia. She can hold 4pc Tenacity of the Millielith.
-   **Bennett** - is another option for the healer slot, and brings a large ATK buff of his own, but has very little Pyro application. He can hold 4pc Noblesse Oblige.
-   **Fischl, Yae Miko, Xiangling, Xingqiu, Yelan, Ganyu, and Rosaria** all provide good off-field damage with strong application of their respective elements, which is valuable for Crystallize shields. Fischl and Yae Miko want 4pc Golden Troupe, Yae in part due to her Burst being a DPS loss. Xiangling, Xingqiu, Yelan, and Ganyu want 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate. Rosaria wants 4pc Noblesse Oblige.

_Recommended combinations include Bennett-Fischl, Furina-Kokomi, Xingqiu-Yelan, Bennett-Furina, Bennett-Yelan, Fischl-Yelan, FIschl-Yae, Ganyu-Rosaria, and Bennett-Xiangling._

### Quickswap

Quickswap Navia is not recommended because her damage is greatly reduced when played as a quickswap DPS, making her not worth running over other potential options.

**Noelle | Navia | Xingqiu | Furina**
![](/faq/navia/noelle.png)

**Neuvillette | Furina | Navia | Kazuha**
![](/faq/navia/neuv.png)
